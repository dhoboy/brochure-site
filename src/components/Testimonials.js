          Drew Grasty provided an excellent tea experience at our Wedding Reception.
          The guests couldn't stop talking about it, they had never seen anything like it!
          Drew is a professional; He set up his station and we enjoyed a smooth evening complete with tea service all night long!

          I had Drew Grastyâ€™s tea magic at my Wedding Party.
          Tea is a peaceful choice, especially when you have guests who cannot drink alcohol.
          Drew has non / less caffeine teas so everyone can enjoy the tea, including children.
          The tea set he has is beautiful, too.
          If you want to make your event extraordinary, he is the one who will make it happen!
